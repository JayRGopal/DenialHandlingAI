Dear Claims Representative,

Re: Appeal of Health Insurance Claim Denial for Procedure CPT Code 99214 (Office/Outpatient Visit)

I am writing to appeal the denial of my recent claim for procedure CPT code 99214, Office/Outpatient Visit, submitted on behalf of Mr. John Doe under policy number HIC-987654321. I strongly disagree with the reason for denial and believe that the procedure is medically necessary.

As per our review of the patient's medical history and clinical documentation, including the visit notes provided, the procedure was deemed Not Medically Necessary based on the absence of a significant change in Mr. Doe's medical condition and lack of documented need for the requested level of care. However, I would like to highlight that Mr. Doe has been experiencing persistent lower back pain for six months, which has significantly impacted his daily activities and quality of life.

The patient visit notes clearly outline the nature and severity of Mr. Doe's symptoms, including chronic radicular symptoms in the right leg and limited range of motion, as well as a thorough assessment and plan of care. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of lumbar strain or mild disc herniation, for which the procedure is intended to provide relief.

I would like to request that the claim be reinstated and approved for the procedure, considering the severity of Mr. Doe's symptoms and the lack of medical necessity. I have attached the visit notes and supporting documentation to this appeal.

Please find below my professional opinion:

* The procedure is medically necessary to alleviate Mr. Doe's chronic lower back pain and radicular symptoms.
* The patient's symptoms and medical history demonstrate a significant change in his condition, warranting medical attention for relief.
* The imaging ordered to rule out disc herniation is reasonable and necessary to provide additional evidence of the claim.

I would appreciate it if you could review this appeal and take into consideration the above points. If there are any additional information or documentation required, please let me know promptly.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Provider
